Atlanta

This is DISGUSTING!

A racist white woman harrassed a black man who was delivering packages in her neighborhood. 

Told him he looked suspicious, insinuated that he might vandalize her property then called the police on him.

THIS IS WHY WE KNEEL

@RosieBarton Well the Bloc is back, the rest of Canada now is forced to carry the racist humiliation of being the only country in North America that has bans on turbans and hijabs and we have decided to economically devastate a province and replace 10s of billions in oil revenue with IOUs.

Even if blackface wasnt inherently racist, it's just so crazy how non black people simply can't respect our request to not turn our skin into a costume that they can wipe off at the end of the day and not experience how this fucking world treats black people on the daily

The FACT is that MUHAMMAD HAQUE had NOT condemned, or attacked Jo Richardson, then MP,  in the way #theTimes "reported". Muhammad Haque had CONDEMNED the racist female "staff" from Labour Party HQ for HER RACIST IDIOCIES. Muhammad Haque DID CRITICISE Jo Richardson's role

@StupidWhiteAds great news, there actually is a company that doesn't need to attack white ppl to advertise its products. I proudly continue to be a Duracell customer. First commercial I've seen in forever that isn't racist and doesn't see color.

@BariDeux My stepfather is atrociously racist and so is my mother though she claims not to be. That is why I will never let my boyfriend near them.

Don't kid yourself. MSNBC hates Bernie far more than they do Trump. Trump's a rapist, racist, unrepentant liar, and still they spend more time attacking Bernie.

If you still don't get that Comcast is controlling their narrative to protect the 1% you're in a coma. 

Wake up.
This is what's getting me through dealing with racist asshats.. ü§¨ https://t.co/xuIT5pqXR7

Of course, any criticism of her actions will be seen as racist and misogynistic.

SHOCKED to hear that the new Charlie‚Äôs Angels movie ‚Äîwhich featured one black, one Indian, and one lesbian lead actress‚Äî bombed. 

This must be bc America is sexist, racist, &amp; homophobic‚Äî and not because people are sick of ‚Äúwoke‚Äù Hollywood movies featuring talentless actors.

If someone from the right were to fat shame a Democrat, we would be up in arms, angrily coming to their defense.

Unpopular opinion: Fat shaming President Trump is hypocritical &amp; makes us no better than him.

Criticize his inhumane, racist, and bigoted policies, not his obesity.

Hey @unc_system: Thanks for inviting your white supremacist buds with the Sons of Confederate Veterans to enshrine their racist statue in our county or another like ours. Thanks for inviting YET MORE white supremacists, skinheads, and Lost Cause ‚Äúheritage‚Äù buffs to terrorize us.

#BorisJohnson isn't racist, he's just old school, where Brits ridicule people for whatever reason.  Comedians used to do this constantly and people with thick skin overlooked it. Anyone seen #EllieGoulding hashtag tonight?  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#Corbyn, however, is a whole new ball game.

@charliekirk11 Awwww your brand of racist, homophobic Christianity is touching and we are all very sorry you can‚Äôt eat fried chicken sandwiches with a side of hate anymore.
Discredited closet Nazi hack "journalists" are still sending racist incel troll bots to harass me over a months old tweet condemning the HK rioters. I was right. They were wrong. The whole world now knows they're just lowlife cowards targeting anyone they think can't fight back.
@glossyhs Oh ok. 
Not sure what I or every single person in the entire universe with white skin did to warrant racist hatred, but alright.

According to Variety, Gabrielle Union was cut from the America‚Äôs Got Talent judge‚Äôs table amid a "toxic environment" surrounding the show. She was let go in part for reporting a taped joke by Jay Leno that was rooted in racist stereotypes.

@BorisJohnson Brexit is not the countries priorities. It was only voted for by 27% of the countries racist white supremacist nationalist misinformed pensioners and village dwelling inbreds that think the black people moving into their village are immigrants rather than British like they are.
you can barely tell the waitress your order is wrong, why would i believe you‚Äôre speaking up to your racist uncle
What's up #MAGA peeps? I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I did! Regardless of what the democrats try to portray about #MAGA supporters, it's all a lie! I guarantee that I'm not racist I just want people here legally! I don't give 2 shits about your skin color! I love all ppl!
Why Everytime they make reboot of a movie and cast black characters a whole bunch of racist ppl pop out of no where?
So when white people are replaced, you are saying they are replaced with incompetence? So only white people are competent according to you? Is that a fact? You sound like a  proud racist to me! https://t.co/wQYco2pmEl
ICE set up a fake University &amp; lured students, mostly from India, to enroll. The students are being arrested on charges of federal conspiracy and deported.

And our taxpayer dollars funded the entire racist, xenophobic, criminal endeavor.

I very foolishly decided to give Question Time another go. It should have been called the Jeremy Corbyn show. The audience seemed full of Labour Party members convinced the NHS is up for sale. Boris was a racist due to his pillar box joke. Brexit was booed but not discussed. Sad.

@TreeFarmer812 @NewsBreaking @StormWatchGirl Why is it racist? He's a pervert and a rapist. There's no such thing as race. Nationality, but not race. You're not thinking clearly. I don't care what nationality he is. I was in movies and was told to steer clear of him. It's what you do that counts. You didn't know that?
